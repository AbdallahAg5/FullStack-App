# FullStack App

#### Description
  This is a fullstack web application that comes equipped with an authentication system, which allows users to register and log in to access the app's features. With the authentication system in place, users can enjoy the added security and privacy that comes with a secure login process.

Furthermore, the app also allows for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on users, giving users the ability to manage their information within the app. This means that users can create new entries, read existing ones, update them as needed, and delete them when they are no longer necessary.

To ensure ease of use, the app also comes with pagination functionality. This means that when there are large numbers of users in the system, they can be broken down into smaller, more manageable groups. Users can then navigate between pages to access the information they need without having to scroll through an excessively long list.

Overall, this app is a powerful tool for managing user data with ease and security, thanks to its full-stack architecture, authentication system, and comprehensive CRUD and pagination functionality.
